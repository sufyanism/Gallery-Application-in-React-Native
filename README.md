## Introduction
Welcome to the React Native Gallery App tutorial! In this project, we'll build a user-friendly app that displays images in a grid, allows full-screen previews, and includes features like filtering and searching. 
This setup guide walks you through the initial environment setup and project creation using Expo CLI.

</br>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/) (install globally)
  
To install Expo CLI globally, run:
`npm install -g expo-cli`


Setup Instructions

1. Create a New Project
Open your terminal and run:
`expo init GalleryApp`
When prompted, select the blank template.

2. Navigate into the Project Folder
`cd GalleryApp`

3. Start the Development Server
`expo start`

This command will launch the Expo Developer Tools in browser.

## Project Structure
After creation, your project folder (GalleryApp/) will have the following structure:
```
GalleryApp/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js               # Main entry point of the app
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/              # Images, fonts, icons
â””â”€â”€ node_modules/        # Installed dependencies
```
